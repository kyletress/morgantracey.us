  <p>Hello world! Sometimes life, and the season gets crazy and I forget to update this site. Sorry! I promise I&rsquo;ll give an update soon. Until then, here some pictures from the season so far. Thank you to all of the incredibly talented photographers who grin and bear the cold for these shots. The shots below were taken by Ron Lebanc.

  <h2><a href="/blog/my-first-donation">My first donation!</a></h2>
  <time>October 16, 2012</time>
  <p>The most surprising thing happened to me a couple days ago. A stranger donated to my Olympic dream! Prior to this donation the only donations I have received were from family and frankly, I cant ask anymore of them. While I love this sport, I am constantly worrying whether Iâ€™ll have enough money to pay my bills and pay for the season. A competitive season costs approximately $8,000-$10,000. Right now Iâ€™m still paying law school loans. Since I donâ€™t live at the training center Iâ€™m also paying all my living expenses. The season just started and while Iâ€™ve just getting the cobwebs out and trying to enjoy my first runs back Iâ€™m already worrying about the expenses of the upcoming season. To receive this random act of kindness from a stranger was not only much needed but greatly appreciated and inspiring. As I finally take my body and my sore neck go bed after my first two days of sliding Iâ€™m little less worried about the season knowing that I do have support out there! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!!!</p>

<p>Look for an update soon about the summer training and the upcoming team trial races. As always, think fast thoughts!!!!</p>

  <p>We keep hearing about athletes going into debt chasing their Olympic dreams. My experience has been training from 3 to 7 hours a day and then heading right to work for 8 hours. Having no financial support is difficult to say the least.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/doing-my-part">Doing my part</a></h2>
  <time>August 21, 2012</time>
  <p>Although I graduated from AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps almost ten years ago, it seems like yesterday when I left small town Champion, Ohio with big dreams of serving others. Since my time in AmeriCorps, I have been a member of an elite Interagency Hotshot firefighting crew, Iâ€™ve graduated from law school and passed the Ohio bar, and I recently began training in the sport of skeleton with the hope of one day representing the United States in the Winter Olympic Games. People frequently ask me why Iâ€™ve chosen to pursue these diverse, challenging endeavors. My answer to this question is always the same. I pursue them because I want to take the path less traveled, and my experience in AmeriCorps gave me the courage to do so. Most importantly, AmeriCorps taught me following my heart could positively impact the lives of others. Whether sliding headfirst down a mile of ice at 90 miles per hour, or being the last line of defense between a wildfire and someoneâ€™s home, Iâ€™m fighting for positive change in my own communities.</p>

<p>An important part of AmeriCorps NCCC mission is to strengthen communities in which we work. In Blythe, CA we helped build twelve homes in which families could raise productive members of society. In Astoria, OR we built a multipurpose space for everything from meetings to disaster relief. In Pasadena, CA we inspired children and encouraged them to play together after school rather than sit in an empty house. In each and every community, we left it stronger than when we arrived.</p>

<p>Our community work was felt at a personal level as well. We inspired one another to be better teammates and better leaders. We learned to embrace change and encourage it in others.To this day I look with admiration at the accomplishments of my ten teammates since graduating AmeriCorps. We entered as young adults, some directly out of high school. Today we are doctors, lawyers, world class athletes, community leaders, and academics. My teammates have competed in World Cups for the US Womenâ€™s Rugby Team. They have volunteered their time teaching in Africa. They have earned Masters degrees and Ph.D.s while working on important community health initiatives. Individually we have done amazing things in our own unique ways, but we will always be united in our desire to effect positive change in our communities.</p>

<p>Being an elite athlete is a selfish undertaking. We spend hours, weeks, months, and years training for just a few moments of glory on the international stage. When I began my pursuit of an Olympic berth, I had to consider that most people will never make it to the Olympics and that I may be one of them. This would have been paralyzing were it not for the lessons I learned in AmeriCorps. I can lead by example. I can inspire positivity. I can dedicate myself to excellence. Most importantly, I can commit to leaving my sport a better place than when I arrived. Similarly to while in AmeriCorps and leaving our communities better than when we arrived. If I do these things, I will succeed.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m thankful every day for my time in AmeriCorps. It is the most important thing I have ever done. Without those experiences I would never have the courage to take the path less traveled. I would never have met the people who pushed me to embrace change while inspiring change in others. If this is what ten people can accomplish in ten short years, what will the future hold? And one day, as I dream of standing in front of a stadium packed with thousands, watching the American flag being raised as the National Anthem plays, it dawns on me. Not even an Olympic stadium can hold the 775,000 talented, inspiring, AmeriCorps alumni whose ranks Iâ€™m proud to be a part of.</p>

  <p>Welcome to my little site where I hope to keep my friends, family, and those random people who search the internet late at night updated on my latest adventure, the pursuit of my Olympic Dream. I realize most people donâ€™t know much about the sport of skeleton but it is a really great sport that I hope to be able to share with those of you interested or bored enough to visit my site. Thanks for visiting and check back for my next post where I tell the story of how after seven years of school, five years of fighting fire and one bar exam later I decided to pursue my Olympic Dream.</p>
