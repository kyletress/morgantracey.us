<h1>About</h1>
<div class="grid">
  <div class="col-2-3">
    <p>Morgan Tracey is the youngest of five children from Champion, Ohio. Morgan is also the only girl. Whether good or bad, Morgan&rsquo;s older brothers made Morgan into the woman she is today, tough and tenacious. Never backing down from a challenge Morgan had her heart set on getting a soccer scholarship and becoming an attorney. To the shock of no one Morgan accomplished both, but as usual, on her own terms. </p>

<p>Upon graduation from Mercyhurst College in Erie, PA, Morgan knew she wanted to give back. Rather than merely spending the weekends volunteering Morgan jumped headfirst and spent ten months as a corps member in AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps. As a corps member Morgan built homes for low income families in Blythe, CA. She also worked within the community on fire safety with the United States Forest Service in Pollock Pines, CA. While in Astoria, OR Morgan and her team worked with Clatsop Community Action to restore a historic building for community use, and with the local food bank. Morgan also prepared taxes for the Voluntary Income Tax Assistance program in Phoenix, AZ and with the Boys and Girls Club in Pasadena, CA. </p>

<p>After AmeriCorps Morgan spent summers working with the Forest Service as a wildland firefighter and a senior firefighter on the Eldorado Interagency Hotshot Crew, one of a few elite wildland firefighting squads and the only girl on her crew. In the winters, Morgan went to law school and in 2010 passed the bar exam. </p>

<p>Most recently, Morgan was invited to the White House by President Obama and awarded the Champions of Change Award for her commitment to national service. Currently, Morgan is part of the United States National Skeleton Program training at the Lake Placid Olympic Training Center in Lake Placid with her sights on Pyeongchang, South Korea.</p>
